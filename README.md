# Smart Health Assistant 🏥

An AI-powered health prediction and recommendation system that helps users understand their health status and receive personalized recommendations. This project aims to provide accessible health insights and preventive care recommendations using machine learning.

## Project Story

The Smart Health Assistant was developed to address the growing need for accessible health monitoring and preventive care. In today's fast-paced world, many people struggle to regularly visit healthcare providers for routine check-ups. This tool serves as a first line of health assessment, helping users:

- Monitor their health metrics regularly
- Get early warnings about potential health risks
- Receive personalized recommendations for lifestyle improvements
- Make informed decisions about when to seek professional medical advice

## Features

- Health condition prediction using multiple ML models
- Personalized health recommendations
- Modern web interface
- Real-time health insights
- User-friendly dashboard
- Data visualization of health metrics

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (Backend)
- React (Frontend)
- Scikit-learn (ML Models)
- TensorFlow (Deep Learning)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Plotly (Data Visualization)

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Users enter their basic health metrics:
   - Age
   - BMI (Body Mass Index)
   - Blood Pressure
   - Heart Rate
   - Cholesterol Level
   - Glucose Level

2. **Analysis**: The system processes this data through three specialized models:
   - Disease Predictor: Evaluates the likelihood of health conditions
   - Risk Assessor: Calculates overall health risk score
   - Health Recommender: Generates personalized recommendations

3. **Output**: Users receive:
   - Health risk assessment
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Visual representation of their health metrics

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application:
